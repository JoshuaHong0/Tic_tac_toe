# Tic_tac_toe
This repository contains the implementations of three different versions of Tic tac toe.

# Project description
This is a project of course CSC442: Artificial Intelligence. In this project, I designed and implemented three programs to play three different versions of Tic tac toe against human players.

All programs are written in JAVA (Version 10.0.1).

# How to build&run these programs

A .jar file is attached to each perogram. You can excute each program by using this command in terminal:

```
java jar + [The path of the .jar file on your computer] 
```
You can also build&run these programs on the IDE you use.
